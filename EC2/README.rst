EC2 Tools Bundle
================

A somewhat stlylized installation of EC2 command-line tools. Don't forget Java for that new Mac of yours.

Run this command in your terminal to install Amazon EC2 API Tools for Mac:

curl -s --create-dirs https://raw.github.com/BrianSpeir/Bundles/master/EC2/Install -o /tmp/EC2/Install; bash /tmp/EC2/Install
