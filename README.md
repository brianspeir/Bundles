Bundles
=======

Making the Mac prettier one bundle at a time.

Bundles ease the installation of apps and insure installations conform to
paradigms set forth on the Mac platform.

Copy, Paste and Install from the command-line.

bash <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/brianspeir/Bundles/master/[name].install)

Standard installers made better.

Chrome
------

We all know Google makes Chrome. This installation eliminates the Google brand from the application name. Go Apple.

Command-Line Tools
------------------

Some of us don't need all of Xcode. This one's for you.

EC2 Tools
---------

A somewhat stlylized installation of EC2 command-line tools. Don't forget Java for that new Mac of yours.

Firefox
-------

Mozilla does it right. This does it better. Install a browser without a browser.

IRC
---

One less app. One more way to communicate.

LibreOffice
-----------

Fuck Microsoft Office.

Projects Folder
---------------

If you hate generic folders you'll love this. A custom folder for all your projects.

SourceTree
----------

For all those who just don't like version control from the command-line. And for those who keep fucking their projects up using version control from the command-line.

Sublime Text
------------

Enough said.

Vagrant and Virtualbox
----------------------

A match made in heaven. And and installer to keep them together.

Wacome
------

The next best thing to pencil and paper.
