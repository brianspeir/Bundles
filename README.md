Bundles
=======

Making the Mac prettier one bundle at a time.

Bundles ease the installation of apps and insure installations conform to
paradigms set forth on the Mac platform.

Copy, Paste and Install from the command-line.

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/brianspeir/Bundles/master/[name].install)
```

Standard installers made better.
