Chrome Bundle
=============

We all know Google makes Chrome. This installation elimitates the Google brand from the application name. Enough said.

Run this command in your terminal to install Google Chrome for Mac:

curl -s --create-dirs https://raw.github.com/BrianSpeir/Bundles/master/Chrome/Install -o /tmp/Chrome/Install; bash /tmp/Chrome/Install
