SourceTree Bundle
=================

For all those who just don't like version control from the command-line. And for those who keep fucking their projects up using version control from the command-line.

Run this command in your terminal to install SourceTree for Mac:

curl -s --create-dirs https://raw.github.com/BrianSpeir/Bundles/master/SourceTree/Install -o /tmp/SourceTree/Install; bash /tmp/SourceTree/Install
