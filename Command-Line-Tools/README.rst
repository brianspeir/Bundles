Command-Line Tools Bundle
=========================

Some of us don't need all of Xcode. This one's for you.

Run this command in your terminal to install Xcode Command-Line Tools:

curl -s --create-dirs https://raw.github.com/BrianSpeir/Bundles/master/Xcode/Install -o /tmp/Xcode/Install; bash /tmp/Xcode/Install
