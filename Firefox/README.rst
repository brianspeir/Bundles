Firefox Bundle
========

Mozilla does it right. This does it better. Install a browser without a browser.

Run this command in your terminal to install Firefox for Mac:

curl -s --create-dirs https://raw.github.com/BrianSpeir/Bundles/master/Firefox/Install -o /tmp/Firefox/Install; bash /tmp/Firefox/Install
