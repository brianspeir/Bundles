Projects Folder Bundle
======================

If you hate generic folders you'll love this. A custom folder for all your project.

Run this command in your terminal to create a Projects folder inside your Home folder.

curl -s --create-dirs https://raw.github.com/BrianSpeir/Bundles/master/Projects-Folder/Install -o /tmp/Projects-Folder/Install; bash /tmp/Projects-Folder/Install
